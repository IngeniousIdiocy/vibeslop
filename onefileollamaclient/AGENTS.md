# One-File Ollama Client Instructions

This directory contains static HTML pages demonstrating a simple Ollama client.

These HTML files are single-file, single-page applications. Everything (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) is embedded directly in the file, so there are no external dependencies. Open `ollamaclient.html` or `glassmorphic-ollama-client.html` in any modern web browser to use the client.
